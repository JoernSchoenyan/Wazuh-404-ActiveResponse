# Wazuh Active Response against malicious 404 traffic
This Active Response for Wazuh compares events with 404 status codes from Apache, Nginx or similar against a database and blocks IPs that scan your websites and applications for vulnerabilities.

## Wazuh settings
TBD

## The database
I will push updates from time to time for the database with suspicious URLs but you'll be able to add them yourself, too. If you want URLs to be added, you can also open an issue.
